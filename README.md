## About

This basic online quiz lets users answer multiple-choice questions and get feedback on how they're doing. The quiz has a timer to keep track of time and a scoring system to evaluate performance. It's built using JavaScript and works in a web browser. The appearance of the quiz is designed to be simple, neat, and easy to use, with the JavaScript code handling dynamic updates to the HTML and CSS for a smooth and responsive user interface.
